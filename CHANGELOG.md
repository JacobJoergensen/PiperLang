# PiperLang Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 (25-05-25)
PiperLang 2.0.0 includes significant improvements to architecture, performance, and security. However, these improvements come with breaking changes that may require updates to your existing code. This document outlines the major changes to help you migrate from version 1.x to 2.0.0.

* PiperLang now is running php 8.4

### Breaking Changes
* The deprecated hooks system has been completely removed as planned.
* The formatDate() method now requires DateTimeImmutable instead of DateTime:
    * Old way: $piperLang->formatDate(new DateTime());
    * New way: $piperLang->formatDate(new DateTimeImmutable());
* The formatNumber() method syntax have been improved:
    * Old way: $piperLang->formatNumber($number);
    * New way: $piperLang->formatNumber($number, $max_fraction_digits = 2);
* The formatCurrency() method behavior change, it will now show the currency symbol as default:
    * Old way: $piperLang->formatCurrency($amount, 'USD', false); // false was default
    * New way: $piperLang->formatCurrency($amount, 'USD', true); // true is default
* The translateWithPlural() method has been removed. If your code used this method for pluralization, you'll need to implement a custom solution.
* Locale files are now automatically loaded when setting a locale. If your code explicitly managed loading, this logic may need to be removed to prevent duplicate loading.

### âœ¨ Major Features
* Introduced a robust detectLocale() method that checks:
    * Session
    * Cookie
    * Browser (Accept-Language header)
    * Fallback to default locale 
    * The result is saved to session/cookie as appropriate
* Added a new setLocale() method that:
    * Accepts a locale string and an optional boolean to force loading the locale.
    * Automatically loads the locale if it hasn't been loaded yet.
    * Returns the current locale after setting it.
* Added a new getTranslation() method that:
    * Accepts a key and an optional locale.
    * Returns the translation for the given key in the specified locale.
    * Uses the current locale if none is provided.
* Improved replaceVariables() method:
    * Uses strtr() for default {{var}} patterns.
    * Falls back to preg_replace_callback() for custom regex patterns.

### ðŸ›  Improvements
* Improved error handling with more descriptive exceptions.

### ðŸ§¹ Removed
* Deprecated hook system (addHook, runHooks) was fully removed.
* translateWithPlural() method removed.
* loadFile() replaced with modern loadLocale() logic.
* getHttpAcceptLanguage() replaced by detectLocale() internally.
* No more internal support for plural_rules â€“ the plural handling feature was dropped.
